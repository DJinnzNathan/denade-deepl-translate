# DeepL Translation Plugin

## Description
This plugin is my first project as I needed it for my work. For building an online language learning system, I needed a quick way to let the users directly translate specific words or sentences on DeepL within a lection.  

## Usage
You can add the translation 

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

## Roadmap
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
