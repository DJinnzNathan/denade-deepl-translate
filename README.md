# DeepL Translation Plugin

## Description
This plugin is my first project as I needed it for my work. For building an online language learning system, I needed a quick way to let the users directly translate specific words or sentences on DeepL within a lection.  

## Usage
You can add the translation tags where shortcodes work. The link is larger than the surrounding text. You can add standard colors or a specific ones as hex or RGB. For example:
``` [DeepL color=#c53222] Das ist ein Beispiel [/DeepL] ```

## Roadmap
- [x] Add globus emoji
- [ ] Add the language code of referened text
- [ ] Add destination language code
- [ ] Add a dropdown with some important languages (or all languages, as DeepL only offers a few)
