A simple shortcode-plugin for WordPress, that generates a link to DeepL with the translation of the string.

== Description ==

This plugin is my first project as I needed it for my work. For building an online language learning system, I needed a quick way to let the users directly translate specific words or sentences on DeepL within a lection. Right now it translates from German to English.

You can add the translation tags where shortcodes work. The link is larger than the surrounding text. You can add standard colors or a specific ones as hex or RGB.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which languages are supported? =

Theoretically all languages that the translation services offers, are supported. When fully setup, the user clicks on the link, which opens the translation page of the service. After that, the user can change the destination language. 

= Can I change the reference language? =

Right now it is only possible by changing the code in the plugin. In a future release I will add the option to setup languages on a settings page or in the shortcode.

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.6 =
* Added Google, Yandex and Baidu translation services

= 0.1.5 =
* Initial release of the plugin.
